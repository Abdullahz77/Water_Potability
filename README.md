Problem :​

The problem was poor water management, whether it is used for drinking, domestic use, food production or recreational purposes.​
According to recent statistics: Unsafe water is  responsible for 1.2 million deaths each year. ​
One-in-four people do not have access to safe drinking water. And others are unable to ​
distinguish between potable and non-potable water even if they have the access to it. ​

​Contaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio. Absent, inadequate, or inappropriately​
managed water and sanitation services expose individuals to preventable health risks. ​

This is particularly the case in health care facilities where both patients and staff are placed at ​additional risk of infection and disease when water, sanitation, and hygiene services are ​
lacking. Globally, 15% of patients develop an infection during a hospital stay, with the ​proportion much greater in low-income Countries like (Jordan). ​

So, I took some inspiration from this to use Machine Learning to distinguish between Potable ​and Non-Potable water. And because the human uses of safe water is a priority,  we are sure ​
that our project will add a great value to society by helping preserve the sustainability of water and its proper use.​

​Project idea :

The project idea is to build a machine learning model that can separate water samples to ​potable and non-potable water only by taking inputs depending
on 9 important targets that are exist in every water sample which are (PH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramine, Sulfate, ​Conductivity, Organic-Carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity). ​

Note: each of these targets is an important signal for the sample quality, and it can make a lot​ of famous and dangerous disses if it is presents in appropriate quantities in water samples. ​
In our project road map, we will update the model to separate the non-potable water from the ​potable water, the non-agricultural water from the agricultural water, and the non-suitable ​
water for human uses from the suitable water for human uses, because most of the population ​of the target country work in agricultural jobs and live on Cultivation of basic nutrients, ​
and most of them are farmers, so we must take care of the water quality for the animals ​they own, because it will be human food.​

So, our model will indicate if water is safe for human consumption where 1 means Potable and 0 means Not potable.​

Our target :​

Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of ​effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a ​
national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water ​supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health ​
effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.​

We are aiming the countries that have some big problems with water management like Jordan.​

Improved water supply and sanitation, and better management of water resources, can boost ​countries’ economic growth and can contribute greatly to poverty reduction. ​
Assuming that the model was perfect, how we can take advantage of this model? ​

The answer is that our machine learning model will be the software of portable water test device, the device will take the inputs and send it to our model, and the model will 
give the clear answer about this sample of water.​

So, we can make profit from selling this device for governments, people, and desalination plants so this can help them to know more about the water they are using, and make monitoring easier ​
and faster on desalination centers and irrigation water.​
